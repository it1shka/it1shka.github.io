      <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
      <p>
        I think most people from our English group
        want to become <span class="cld">software developers</span> in 
        their future. At least, according
        to the survey we took on the previous
        lesson :) Programming is not a 
        strictly defined area. Programming is not 
        a strictly defined area. There are a 
        <span class="cld">lot of directions</span> in programming. 
        You can be anything: you can design 
        robots, you can write games, 
        you can implement your own low-level 
        systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of such directions is Web Development!
        In simple terms, it's a job where you create websites.

      <h2>Is it difficult?</h2>
      <p>
        Web Development is <span class="cld">tough</span> beacuse
        there are too many things you need to
        know! To create a fully-fledged website you 
        need to know both how to create 
        user interfaces and servers.

        </span> + <span style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0)">
          Back-end
        </span></h2>
      <p>
        The first part of your website is 
        <span class="cld">front-end</span>.
        This is all about creating and coloring 
        buttons, panels, navbars... 
      </p>

      <p>
        To be successful in front-end you need to deeply
        know <span class="cld">HTML and CSS + JavaScript</span> 
        as well as any of JS libraries.

      </p>

      <p>
        Creating layout of your app 
        is a very exciting process that touches
        a lot of aspects from design and requires
        a lot of <span class="cld">imagination</span>
      </p>

    <section class="paragraph">
      <h2>What is back-end?</h2>
      <p>
        It is usually <span class="cld">harder to implement</span> 
        back-end than front-end. You have to deal with 
        <span class="cld">servers and databases</span>. Usually it is a pretty complex
        task to manage all the systems on your server.
