      <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
      <p>
        I think most people from our English group
        want to become <span class="cld">software developers</span> in 
        their future. At least, according
        to the survey we took on the previous
        lesson :) Programming is not a 
        strictly defined area. There are a 
        <span class="cld">lot of directions</span> in programming. 
        You can be anything: you can design 
        robots, you can write games, 
        you can implement your own low-level 
        systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of such directions is Web Development!
        In simple terms, it's a job where you create websites. 
      </p>

      <h2>Is it difficult?</h2>
      <p>
        Web Development is <span class="cld">tough</span> beacuse
        there are too many things you need to
        know! To create a fully-fledged website you 
        need to know both how to create 
        user interfaces and servers.

        <span style="color: rgb(0, 217, 255)">
          Front-end
        </span> + <span style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0)">
          Back-end
        </span></h2>
      <p>
        The first part of your website is 
        <span class="cld">front-end</span>.
        This is all about creating and coloring 
        buttons, panels, navbars... 
      </p>

      <p>
        To be successful in front-end you need to deeply
        know <span class="cld">HTML and CSS + JavaScript</span> 
        as well as any of JS libraries.

        </div>
      </p>

      <p>
        Creating layout of your app 
        is a very exciting process that touches
        a lot of aspects from design and requires
        a lot of <span class="cld">imagination</span>
      </p>

      <h2>All the fancy styling and interaction is front-end!</h2>
      <p>
        <button id="alert">Click me!</button>
      </p>
      <p>
        <button id="counter">Increase!</button>
        <p id="display">Clicked: 0</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <button id="bomb">Don't touch it!</button>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="paragraph">
      <h2>What is back-end?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually it is <span class="cld">much harder to implement</span>
        backend for your website than to deal with widgets.
        When you are a back-end developer you need to deal with 
        <span class="cld">servers and databases</span>, 
        and it's pretty complex stuff!
      </p>
      <div>
        <img class="logo" src="server.png"> 
        <img class="logo" src="phplogo.png"> 
        <img class="logo" src="nodejslogo.jpg"> 
      </div>
      <p>
        And if on the front-end part you will use
        JavaScript as your primary language,
        on backend it's <span class="cld">up to you</span> which technology
        to choose!
